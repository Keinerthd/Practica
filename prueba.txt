Mighty dragon, thou'rt a trueborn heir.
Lend me thy strength, o kindred.
Deliver me unto greater heights.

...Well
A lowly Tarnished,
playing as a lord.
I command thee, kneel!
I am the lord of all that is golden!
 AAaaahhhhh Gaaaghhhhgghhhh uugh uuaaaghrr... ugggh uuuaaaagh...
 Ahh, truest of dragons.
Lend me thy strength...
Nnngh
Forefathers, one and all...
Bear witness!
